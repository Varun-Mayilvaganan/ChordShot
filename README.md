# Chordshot: AI-Powered Image-to-Music Generation

## Project Description
Chordshot is an innovative AI-powered application that merges image recognition and music generation to create a personalized auditory experience based on visual content. By analyzing images to detect emotional tones, objects, and scenes, it generates a 30-second background music track that matches the mood of the image. This tool is ideal for content creators, videographers, and marketers who wish to effortlessly add personalized soundtracks to their visual content.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Detects objects, emotions, and scenes within an image using pre-trained deep learning models.
- **Music Generation**: Uses AI-driven models (Magenta) to generate a music track that matches the visual content's mood.
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically maps image features to musical properties such as tempo, scale, and instruments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to upload images and download generated music with a single click.

## Tech Stack
- **Image Recognition & Analysis**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (ResNet, YOLO, EfficientNet) - Image recognition, scene recognition.
- **Music Generation**: Magenta by Google
- **Backend**: FastAPI or Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage & Deployment**: Amazon S3, Heroku / DigitalOcean
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Deployment & CI/CD**: Docker, AWS.
